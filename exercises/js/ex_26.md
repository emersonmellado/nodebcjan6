# Exercise 26

* Create a new index26.js file
* We need to define Winnipeg using variables and all the data types that we learned
* Declare `at least 6 variables` that will help you describe the city
* Try using at least one variable of each type
* Show each value using console.log() with the variable name (string) as first parameter and the actual variable value as second
* Example: `console.log('name', name);` 
* Also show the variable names and the type of value it has assigned (use typeof)
