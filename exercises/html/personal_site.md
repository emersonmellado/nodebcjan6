# Personal Site

* Create my-site folder

* Create a personal site about you, something that you're passionate about or it can be your site as web developer
* The site must include everything that we saw so far
* It will have at least 6 linked html documents
* Think about this exercise as if you owned a real web application
* All images must be in assets/img folders
* All html documents must have a good HTML structure and indentation
* Create different documents sections using divs with proper id or class depending the case
* All document title (head) must describe the document content
* Every html document must have a main title
* Use other titles (h2, h3, h4, h5 & h6) if needed
* Add an Horizontal Rule to divide different sections
* If the paragraph content gets too long add some break lines to it
* Some texts or words must be strong depending upon the content
* Use generic inline container (spans) to highlight some words
```html
<span style="color: red;">
```
* Use this code to highlight the selected spans. You can choose the color
* Each document must have a multiline comment with the updates you'll have to do
* Create at least one of each type of lists. They should make sense depending the content of the document
* Please use paragraphs for the text content instead of just leaving it on the document without a structure
* Add a external link (with absolute URL)
* Use relative paths to link your site documents
* One of the html document must have anchors and you need to call them from a different html document
* Add a contact email link
* Search and add images from google. You can use absolute URLs or download some and use relative paths
* Add an image gallery using figure and figure caption elements
* Create at least 2 content tables (please use all table section body, head and foot)
